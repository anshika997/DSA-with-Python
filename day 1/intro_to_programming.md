# Day 01 – Introduction to Programming 

## 1. What is a Programming Language?
A programming language is a medium used to communicate instructions to a computer
so that it can perform a specific task.

## 2. HLL vs LLL
### High Level Language (HLL)
- Easy to read and write
- Human understandable
- Example: Python, Java, C++

### Low Level Language (LLL)
- Machine dependent
- Hard to understand
- Example: Machine language, Assembly language

## 3. Compiler vs Interpreter
### Compiler
- Converts whole code at once
- Faster execution
- Example: C, C++

### Interpreter
- Converts code line by line
- Slower but easy debugging
- Example: Python, JavaScript
