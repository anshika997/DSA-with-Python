DSA Revision Notes (Day 1–10)

Day 1–2: Python Fundamentals
- Learned basics of Python syntax
- Variables, data types, input and output
- Variable naming rules and snake_case convention
- Type casting for numerical operations

Day 3–4: Control Flow
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Comparison and logical operators
- for and while loops
- Solved basic number-based problems using loops

Day 5: Functions
- Defined and used functions
- Understood parameters and return values
- Importance of modular and reusable code

Day 6–7: Time and Space Complexity
- Introduction to time complexity
- Common complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2)
- Space complexity basics
- Importance of optimized solutions

Day 8: Recursion
- Concept of recursion and recursive calls
- Base case and recursive case
- Understanding recursion stack
- Difference between recursion and iteration

Day 9–10: Problem Solving & Optimization
- Solved math-based problems
- Power of 2 / Power of 3 using loops and recursion
- Tribonacci sequence using iterative approach
- GCD using Euclidean algorithm
- Focused on writing optimized and clean code

Common Problem-Solving Patterns
- Digit problems → use % and //
- Power problems → repeated division
- Sequence problems → sliding window variables
- GCD problems → modulo-based recursion
- Optimization → iterative solutions preferred over recursion

LeetCode Problems Practiced
- FizzBuzz
- Power of 2
- Power of 3
- Tribonacci Number
- GCD / HCF

Goal
- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Improve logical thinking
- Build consistency through daily practice
- Prepare strong fundamentals for interviews
